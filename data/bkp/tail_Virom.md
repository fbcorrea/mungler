Given the limited number of samples analyzed, few conclusions could be drawn concerning the differences between adult pigs and piglets, nor between animals treated with many/few antibiotics. We noted however that piglets had significantly higher abundances of Caudovirales compared to adult pigs, as well as fewer ssDNA eukaryotic viruses. The abundance of ARG genes found in microbiota did not correlate with the (recently applied) antibiotic treatments. The tetR genes were the most abundant overall, and most likely reflected the past practice, now forbidden in Europe, of antibiotic use for animal growth.

In conclusion, the consistent observations that ARGs are rarely encoded by phages is encouraging for the fight against antibiotic resistance, as well as for phage therapy. These results suggest that this type of mobile genetic element should not pose a threat, except in phages with high levels of generalized transduction. This is also good news in terms of safety for the use of phages to combat recalcitrant infections, as with the exception of those with high transduction levels, phages should not lead to ARG spread.
