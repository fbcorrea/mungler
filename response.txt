 Alice shrank after swallowing a cake, which she did because she thought the cake was the cause of her growing larger earlier in the story. This conclusion was drawn from the narrative poem recited at the beginning of the chapter, which described something being given to a 'her' and a 'him', but when it came to 'you' and 'us', multiple items were handed out. The 'atom of meaning' that Alice mentioned referred to her interpretation that if the cake didn't make her grow larger, then logically, it should make her shrink.
